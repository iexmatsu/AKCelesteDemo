# AKCelesteDemo

Sound design exercise based on MixAndJam's CelesteMovementDemo, 
sound creation using Audiokinetic's audio middleware Wwise, 
all sounds are done in a Synth-Based way, 
more than half of the sounds are done with SynthOne as the sound source.

After downloading and unzipping, 
please reassign the Wwise project path in Project Settings - Wwise Editor and generate Soundbank, 
otherwise the game will not work properly.

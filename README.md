## Sound Features

### Time Freeze state

- Tried to implement some of Quantum Break's sound design in this small-scale project, introducd slow motion, time standstill, and more.

- Reverse-able dymamic music

- It is also a tribute to Quantum Break, referencing the time travel music design.

### Dash

- Dash triggers slow motion, affects music playback speed, and drives the Bitcrusher effects on the ambient sound and music buses.

### Jump

### Falling

- Triggers the sound generated by the air friction between the falling character and the air by determining whether the character's falling speed reaches a certain value.

### Random voice for the idle state

- In order to give the robot character a more organic feel through sound, a few tricks were used to create rich and varied speech and to use that speech to influence visual representation

### Custom bitcrusher plugin

- Simple Bitcrusher effect plug-in made with PureData+Heavy, Win64 and x86 versions of the plug-in are included in the project.
